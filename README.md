# Debugging-Assignment
Project for new students to familiarize themselves with the Java Environment Debugger
I developed this code as part of a larger project for Decision Trees. However, due to complexity and the lack of student familiarity with ML concepts and understanding,
relevant parts were turned into a debugging assignment for students to understand the concepts of good programming. As a result, this project is intended to be quite versatile in 
allowing students to recognize errors in the provided code and develop their own solutions. So long as the implemented solutions results in similar output values, this should help 
reduce overhead in instructors and TA's debugging their students code.
